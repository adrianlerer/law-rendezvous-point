## PRELIMINARY SYNTHESIS: Database Evidence

### Available Datasets:

| Database | Sample Size | Key Variables | Access |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **SCCS** | 186 societies | 1,156 variables incl. legal complexity | eScholarship / HRAF |
| **Ethnographic Atlas** | 1,291 societies | Political complexity (0-4), subsistence type | D-PLACE / JSTOR |
| **eHRAF World Cultures** | ~400 cultures | Full ethnographic texts (searchable) | HRAF (trial?) |

### Testable Hypotheses Using Databases:

**Hypothesis 1**: Legal complexity correlates with subsistence type
- **Test**: Regress EA political complexity (0-4) on subsistence variables
- **Prediction (H-B)**: Agriculture → Higher legal complexity (reciprocity institutionalization)
- **Prediction (H-A)**: Coercion-based (would predict warfare/conflict → legal complexity)

**Hypothesis 2**: Settlement patterns predict legal complexity
- **Test**: Nomadic vs sedentary societies on EA legal complexity scale
- **Prediction (H-B)**: Sedentary → Higher legal complexity (repeated interactions → reciprocity norms)

**Hypothesis 3**: Population size predicts legal complexity
- **Test**: SCCS population variable vs legal system variable
- **Prediction**: Larger populations → More complex law (need for third-party enforcement)

**Hypothesis 4**: Hunter-gatherers have proto-norms but not proto-law
- **Test**: eHRAF text search for "punishment," "rules," "norms" in hunter-gatherer societies
- **Prediction**: Find informal norms (reciprocity-based) but NOT formal legal codes

### Critical Analysis Path:

```
Step 1: Access SCCS/EA data (D-PLACE, eScholarship)
   ↓
Step 2: Run correlations:
   - Subsistence → Legal complexity
   - Settlement → Legal complexity
   - Population → Legal complexity
   ↓
Step 3: Identify TRANSITION POINT:
   - At what subsistence level does legal complexity jump?
   - Hunter-gatherers: complexity = 0
   - Simple agriculture: complexity = 1-2?
   - Complex agriculture: complexity = 3-4?
   ↓
Step 4: Cross-check with eHRAF ethnographies:
   - Read full descriptions of transition-zone societies
   - Look for descriptions of norm formalization process
   ↓
Step 5: Compare with archaeological timeline:
   - EA/SCCS transition point ≈ Agriculture adoption?
   - Align with Hammurabi (~1750 BCE), Ur-Nammu (~2100 BCE)
```

### Expected Findings (Tentative):

**If Hypothesis B (Reciprocity) is correct**:
- EA data will show: Agriculture → Legal complexity (reciprocity needs institutionalization)
- eHRAF will show: Hunter-gatherers have reciprocity norms (food-sharing, meat distribution) but NOT formal law
- SCCS will show: Legal complexity correlates with interdependence (trade, commerce), NOT just coercion

**If Hypothesis A (Coercion) is correct**:
- EA data will show: Warfare/conflict → Legal complexity
- eHRAF will show: Hunter-gatherers lack law because they lack states (coercion capacity)
- SCCS will show: Legal complexity correlates with military organization, NOT commerce
