## PRELIMINARY SYNTHESIS: Primatology Findings

### What Non-Human Primates HAVE (Proto-Law Capabilities):

1. **Inequity Aversion** (Brosnan & de Waal 2003)
   - Capuchins reject unequal pay
   - Sense of fairness exists pre-linguistically
   
2. **Reciprocal Food-Sharing** (Mitani & Watts 2001)
   - Chimps selectively share with reciprocating partners
   - Multi-commodity exchange (grooming, meat, support)
   
3. **Knowledge Tracking** (Call & Tomasello 2008)
   - Chimps know what others know (saw/didn't see)
   - Competitive vs cooperative contexts

4. **Social Norms (Basic)** (de Waal, various)
   - Enforcement via aggression/ostracism
   - Dominance hierarchies with rule-like regularities

### What Non-Human Primates LACK (Barriers to Proto-Law):

1. **False Belief Understanding** (Call & Tomasello 2008)
   - Cannot attribute beliefs differing from reality
   - **Implication**: Cannot comprehend "rule violation" as belief-state
   
2. **Shared Intentionality** (Tomasello 2021)
   - Cannot jointly commit to shared goals
   - **Implication**: Cannot create **collective agreements** (contracts)
   
3. **Reason-Giving** (Tomasello & González-Cabrera 2021)
   - Cannot justify norms with reasons
   - **Implication**: Norms remain implicit, cannot be articulated/debated
   
4. **Third-Party Punishment** (Not found in this search, but noted in literature)
   - Chimps enforce against themselves, not as impartial observers
   - **Implication**: No "judge" role

### THE RUBICON (Primatology Perspective):

**Hypothesis from Primatology Evidence**:

The Rubicon occurs when **shared intentionality** emerges, enabling:
1. **Collective agreements** (proto-contracts)
2. **Explicit norm articulation** (reason-giving via language)
3. **Third-party enforcement** (judge role, not just victim retaliation)

**Timeline Clues**:
- Tomasello (2012): Collaborative foraging → shared intentionality
- When did collaborative foraging emerge? (~2 million years ago with Homo erectus? Earlier?)

**Key Transitions**:
```
Step 1: Reciprocal altruism (present in chimps, ~6-7 million years old)
   ↓
Step 2: Collaborative foraging (Homo erectus? ~2 million years ago?)
   ↓
Step 3: Shared intentionality emerges (language? ~500k-200k years ago?)
   ↓
Step 4: Explicit norms (oral law, ~50k years ago?)
   ↓
Step 5: Written law (Ur-Nammu, ~4,000 years ago)
```

### Critical Gaps to Fill:

1. **When did shared intentionality emerge?** (Archaeological/fossil evidence?)
2. **Was language necessary or sufficient?** (Language ≠ shared intentionality automatically)
3. **False belief understanding in great apes** (Controversy - 2017 study vs 2008 conclusion)
4. **Third-party punishment in primates** (Need explicit search)

2. **Retrieve PMC 2017** - False belief controversy resolution
3. **Search for**: Third-party punishment in primates (Fehr, Henrich)
4. **Search for**: Archaeological evidence of collaborative foraging timelines
5. **Search for**: Language emergence timelines (crosscheck with shared intentionality)

**Critical Retrievals**: 8 (Tomasello papers, Mitani & Watts, Brosnan & de Waal)
