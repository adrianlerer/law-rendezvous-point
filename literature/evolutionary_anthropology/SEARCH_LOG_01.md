- **Status**: TO BE RETRIEVED

#### 9. **JSTOR: "Legal Evolution in Primitive Societies"**

**Pro-Reciprocity (Hypothesis B)**:
- Axelrod (1984): Cooperation emerges WITHOUT central authority
- Trivers (1971): Reciprocal altruism precedes structured norms
- Cambridge excerpt: "All law begins with custom"
- Boyd & Richerson (multiple papers): Norms/institutions emerge SPONTANEOUSLY from cultural evolution

- (None found yet in this search batch)

### Temporal Clues Found:
- Boyd & Richerson: ~1 million years of cultural learning evolution
- IntergentES: Seven phases over millennia (Africa-specific, needs retrieval)

1. **Need quantitative data**: How much of ancient codes is contracts vs crime?
2. **Need primatology comparison**: What do chimps have/lack for proto-law?
3. **Need formal models**: Game theory predictions for norm→law transition
